# Valorant champions wiki by Christophe Irani

##API
I used "https://valorant-api.com/v1/agents" as my API because, there wasn't an other Riot games API, easier to use.

##Champion List
I used a Recycler View for showing my champion list. I also used a Cardview for a better design, and I choosed the valorant theme colors and font.

##Champion Detail
I had a string Uuid for calling a page for every champion so I've maded a list of all these Uuids. But for some reason, the API didn't answer when we called it for the Champion's detail so I couldn't show any information about them in the second page.

##TODO

I have to fix the Champion Detail, and show more informations like the champions's abilities.
